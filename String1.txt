					********* String Assignment 1 **********

Q1. what is String in java ?

ANS : String is a sequence of characters . But in java, string is an object that represents a sequence of
	characters . the java.long.String class is used to create a string object.

Q2. Type of string are ?

ANS : in java String are classified into 2 types
		* Mutable String
		* Immutable String

Q3. in how many ways can you create string object in java ?

ANS : there are two ways to create string object in java . one is using a new operator and another 
	one is using string literals. the object using the new operator are stored in the heap memory
	and object created using String literals are stored in the string constant pool.

	String str1 = new String("xyz"); // Creating string object using new operator 
	String str2 = "xyz";		       // Creating string object using string literal

Q4. what is a string constant pool ?

ANS : string object are the most commonly used data object in java. Hence , java has a special
	arrangment to store the string objects. string constant pool is one such arrangement.
	string constant pool is the heap memory space dedicated to storing string object created with
	string literals . in the string constant pool , there will be no two string object with the same content.

	when you use a string literal to create a string , JVM first checks the object's conten . if there is an 
	object . it doesn't create a new object . if the content differs from the existing objects, nonevent is 
	generated.

Q5. what do you mean by "mutable" and "immutable" objects ? 

ANS : Immutable object are like constants . you can't modify them once they are created . they are
	final in nature. whereas mutable object are concerned, you can perform modifications on them.

Q6. where exactly is the string constant  pool located in the memory ?

ANS : inside the heap memory.JVM reserves some part of the heap memory to store string object created using 
	string litaral. in java , string are special .String types receive special treatment in java that other types do not.
	for  example, to create the string objects , you have do not need to use the "new"  keyword. wheres to create other
	types of java. this attention is wort the while, because thy string are used almost everywhere while developing any 
	kind of application.
