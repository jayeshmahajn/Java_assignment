				*************Arrays Assignment*************

Q1. what is the default value of Array for different data type ?

ANS:  		Data Type					Default value

		Byte,short,int,long	----------->		o
		      float,double		----------->		0.0
			boolean		----------->		false
		       any object		----------->		null



Q2. can you the negative nunber in array size ?

ANS: no, you can not pass the negative number as array size. if you pass a negative number in array
	size then you will not get the compiler error. instead,
	you will get the NegativeArraySizeException at run time.


Q3.what does array stored in JVM memory ?

ANS: Array is an object in java.so, array is stored in heap memory in JVM.


Q4.what are the disadvantages of Array ?

ANS: 
	*to create an array, contiguous memory is required.it is possible in JVM that the memory is
	   available to accommodate array but memory available is not contiguous.
	*the array is static data structure .it is of fixed size. we can not increase or decrease the size of
	   the array after craction.


Q5.what is an anonymous array in java ? Give an example .

ANS : an array without any name(or reference) is called an anonymouse
	array. they are useful for the scenarios where we need one time usage of array.

For Example :

class calc
{
    public int add (int num[])
    {
        int result =0;
        for(int n:num)
        {
            result=result +n;
         
        }
        return result;
    }
}
    public class array
    {

    public static void main(String [] args)
     {
     calc obj=new calc();
     int result=obj.add(new int[] {1,3,4,3});
     System.out.println(result);
     }
    }


Output : 11

Q6. what are the different ways to traverse an array in java ?

ANS: * Using for loop

	* Using for each loop

Q7. what is the difference between length and length() method give an examples ?

ANS: Lenght  :-
An array is an object that holds a fixed number of values of the some type.
the length variable in an array returns the length of an array i.e. a number of elements stored in an array.

once arrays are initiailized,its length cannot be changed, so the length variable can directly be used to get the length
of an array. the length variable is used only for an array.

Example :
public class arr_length
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int a[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7};
        System.out.println("length of an array is :"+a.length);    
    }    
}


Output :- length of an array is : 7


Length() :-
the length() method is a static method of String class
the length() returns the length of a string object i.e. the number of characters stored in an  object.
string class uses this method because the length of a string can be modified using the various oprations on
an object. 

the string class internally uses a char[] array that it does not expose to the outside world.

Example:-
public class arr_length
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        String str = "Hello World";
        System.out.println("Length of string using length() method is :"+str.length());
    }    
}


Output :- Length of string using length() method is : 11
