										**************Fundamentals of Java************


Q1:what is programming language?
ANS :programming is a practice that strengthens our capacity for logical thought and problem-solving.it teaches 
	us how to carry out a task whit the aid of software or a computer program.programming is help to interact
	with computer.


Q2:why do we need a programming language?
ANS: programming language it is vocabulary and a collection of rule that command a computer,devices,
	application to work according to the written codes.the programming language enables us to write 
	efficient programs and develop online  solutions such as-mobile applications,weba applications,and
	games,etc.programming is used to automate,maintain,assemble,measure,and interpret the processing
	of the data and information.


Q3:features of java?
ANS: * object-oriented-the featuares of object-oriented programming are supported by java.its object model is
	straightforward and fixible.

	* platform independent-because java and c++ are platform indenpendent,application programs created in
	one operating system can run on any other operating system.c and c++,however,are platform dependent 
	languages,making it impossible for application programs created int one operating system to run in
	any other oparating system.
	
	* simple-because java incorporates many c/c++ capabilities,it is simple to understand.

	* secure-java offers a variety of defences against malware and viruses.it guarantees that neither damage
	nor security will be compromised.

	*portable-we have the idea of portability in java.java allows the same software to run on various platforms.

	*multi-threaded-java's multithreading programming capability enables during program development.
	executes multiple tasks concurrently.
	
	*distributed-java maintains the TCP/lP protocol and is therefore suitable for distributed internet 
	environments.


Q4:what is an object?
ANS: An object is an entity with state and behaviour,sure as a chair,bike,marker,pen,table,or car.it could be
	intellectual or physical(tangible and intagible). the banking system is an illustration of an intangible
	entity.

Q5:what is a class?
ANS: class is a collection of items with similar characteistics.it serves as a model or blueprint from which
	things can be made.it makes sense as a whole.it cannot be bodily.


Q6:explain aboute the java main()menthod?
ANS: the main() is the starting point for JVM to start execution of a java program.without the main() mathod,
	JVM will not execute the progrm.the syntax of the main() mathod is:public:it is an access specifier.we
	should use a public keyword befoe the main() method so that JVM can identifiy the execute point of the 
	progrm.

	public static void main(string args[])

	 *public:- an access specifier,that is.before calling the main() method,we need to use the public keyword to let
		      the JVM know where the programme is actually being executed.before the main() method,if we use private,
		      protected,and defualt,the JVM won't be able to see it.

	*static:-you can make a method static by using the keyword static.we should call the main() method without
	            creating an object.static methods are the method are the method which is invoked without creating the 
	             objects,so we do notneed any object to call the main() method.

	*void:-in java, every method has the return type.void keyword acknowledges the compiler that the main()
		method does not return any value.

	*main():-it is a default signature which is predefined in the JVM to execute a program line by line
		      and end the execution after completion of this method .we can also overload the main() method .

	*string args[]:-the main() method also accepts some data from the user. it accepts a group of strings, which is 
			       called a string array.it is used to hold the commond line arguments in the form of string values.

									main(string args[])

				here,agrs[] is the array name,and it is of string type.it means that it can store a group of strings.renamber,
				this array can store a group o f numbers but in the form of string only. values passed to the main() method 
				are called arguments.these arguments are stored into an args[] array,so the name args[] is generally used 
				for it.





											*************Java variables and Data Type*************

Q1. What is statically typed and Dynamically typed Programming Language?
Ans: Statically typed: if the memory of the variable is given during the compilation time itself then such types of
	programming languages are called as “Statically typed”.

		Eg: C,C++,Java

	Dynamically typed: If the memory of the variable is given during the execution time itself then such types of
	programming languages are called as “dynamically typed”.

		Eg: Python,PHP,JavaScript


Q2. What is the variable in Java?
Ans: A variable is the title of a reserved region allocated in memory. In other words, it may be referred to as the
	name of a memory location.

	It is a container that holds the value while the Java Program is executed.

	Each variable should be given a unique name to indicate the storage area.

	A variable is assigned with a data type(we will learn about it after this topic).

	Syntax for Declaring a Variable:

	Type variable_name [= value];

	The variable_name is the name of a variable. We can initialise the variable by specifying an equal sign and a
	value (initialization i.e. assigning an initial value, is optional). However, the compiler never assigns a default
	value to an uninitialized local variable in Java.


Q3. How To Assign a Value To Variable?
Ans: We use assign operator (=) to assign a value to a variable. For Example,
	number = 10;
	flag = true;
	name = "CodePumpkin";

	We can assign a value to a variable any number of times in Java, but when we assign a new value to a
	variable, the old value will be overwritten.
	For example, in the first code snippet, we have first assigned a value 10 to the number and then modified its
	value by performing the number+20 operation and assigning it back to the variable number by .

Q4. What are Primitive Data types in Java?
Ans: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, String, boolean.

Q5. What are the Identifiers in Java?
Ans: Identifiers in Java are symbolic names used for identification. They can be a class name, variable name,
	method name, package name, constant name, and more. However, In Java , There are some reserved words
	that can not be used as an identifier.

Q6.list the operator in java ?
ANS: operators in java:
	*Arithmetic operators
	*Logical operators
	*Relational operators
	*Unery operators
	*Bitwise operators
	*assigment operators


Q7.Explain about increment and decrement operators and give an examples ?
ANS: increment and decrement operators in java are used to increase ro decrease the value by 1 for example,
	increamental operator ++ i s useful to increase the existing variable value by (i=i+1).moreover,the decrement
	operator -- is useful to decrease or subtract the current value by 1(i=i-1). the syntax of both increment and 
	decrement operators in java programming to prefix or postfix is 

		increament operator :++x or x++

		decrement operator: --x or x-
