				*************  constructor Assignment ***********

Q1. what is constructor ? 

Ans : Constructor is used to initialize the object's state. Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements
	(i.e. instructions ) that are executed at time of object creation.

Q2. what is Constructor chaining ?

Asn : Constructor chaining is a technique of calling another constructor from one constructor. this() is used to call the same 
	class constructor wherease super() is used to  call super class constructor . 

Q3. can we call a subclass constructor from a superclass constructor ?

Ans :  No. there is no way in java to call a subclass constructor from a superclass constructor.

Q4. What happens if you keep a return type for a constructor ?

Ans :  Ideally , constructor must not have a return type. by definition , if a method has a return type , it's not a constructor 
	(JLS8.8 Declaration ) it will be treated as a normal method . but compiler gives a warning saying that method has a 
	constructor name. 

Example : 
class Demo 
{
	int Demo()
	{
		return 0; // Waring for the return type 
	}
}

Q5. what is non- arg constructor ?

Ans : Constructor without arguments is called a no - arg constructor. Default constructor in java is always a no- arg constructor.

class demo
{
	public demo()
	{
		//No- arg constructor
	}
}

Q6. How is No - argument constructor defferent from the defualt constructor ?

Ans : if a class contains no constructor declarations, then a defualt constructor with no formal parameters and no throw clause is implicitly
	declared. if the class being decleared is the primordial class object, then that defualt constructor has an empty body . otherwise , the 
	default constructor simply invoke the superclass constructor with no arguments.

Q7. When do we need constructor Overloading ?

Ans : Sometimes there is a need to initialize an object in different ways. this can be done using constructor Overloading . different constructors can 
	do different work by implementing different lines of code and are called based on the type and no of parameters passed According to the 
	situation, a constructor is called with a specific number of parameters among overloading constructors.

Q8.What is default constructor 

Ans : Default constructor 
* for every java class constructor concept is applicable.
* if we don't write any constructor . then the compiler will generate a default constructor .
* if we write at least one constructor then the compiler won't generate any default constructor , so 
  we say every java class will have a compiler generated default constructor or programmer written 
   constructor but not both simultaneously.
