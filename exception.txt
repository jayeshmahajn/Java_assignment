			************** Exception Handling Assignment **************


Q1. Exaple different types of error in java .

Ans : In any programming language we categorise error into 2 types
	1.Syntax Error / Compile Time Mistakes
	2. Logical Error / Run Time Mistakes

Syntax error / CompilTime Mistakes

* it refers to the mistakes done by the programmer with respect to syntax.
*These mistakes are identified by the compiler, so we say it as "CompileTimeMistakes".

Logical error / RunTime Mistakes

* it refers to the mistakes done by the programmer in terms of writing a logic
* These mistakes are identified by JVM during the execution of a program, so we say it as "RunTimeMistakes ".

Q2. What is an Exception in java.

Ans : An Unwanted / expected event that disturbs the normal flow of execution of a program is called is " Exception handiling".
*The main object of exception handiling is to handle the exception.
*it is available for graceful termination of program.

Q3.How can you handle exceptions in java ? Explain with an example.

Ans : Exception handiling can be performed using :

Try : the set of statements or code which requires monitoring for an exception is kept under this block.
Catch : this block catches all the exception that were trapped in the try block.
Finally : this block is always performed irrespective of the catching of exceptions in the try or catch block.

Example : 
import java.util.Scanner;

public class exception2
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        int num =0;
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);    
        try
        {
        num = sc.nextInt();
        }
        catch(Exception e )
        {
            sc.close();
            System.out.println("plase try only Nomber value.");
        }
        System.out.println(num);

    }    
}


Q4. why do we need exception handiling in java ?

Ans : if there is no try and catch block while an exception occurs, the program will terminate . exception handiling ensures the smooth
	running of a program without program termination.

Q5. What is the different between exception and error in java ?

Ans : Error typically happen while an application is running. for instance , out of memory Error occurs in case the JVM runs out of memory
	On the hand, exceptions are mainly caused by the application. for instance, null pointer Exception happens when an app tries to get through
	a null object.

Q6. Name the different types of exception in java ?

Ans : Based on handiling by JVM , there are typically two types of exception in java .

Checked : Occur during the compilaion . here, the compiler checks whether the exception is handled and throws an error accoringly.

Unchecked : Occur during program exception. these are not detectable during the compilation process.

Q7. Can we just try instead of finally and catch blocks  ? Give an Example ?

Ans : No, doing so wil show a compilation error. catch or finally block must always accompany try block. we can remove either finally
block or catch block , but never both.
