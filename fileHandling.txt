Q1. What is input and Output Stream in java ?

Ans :  A Stream can be defined as a sequence of data. the inputStream is used to read data from a source and 
the OutStream is used for writing data to a destination

Q2. What are the methods of OutStream ?

Ans : 
* Write() - writing the specified byte to the output stream.

*Write(byte[] array) - write the byte from the specified array to the output stream.

* flush() - forces to write all data present in the output stream to the destination.
* close() -close the output stream.

Q3. What is serialization in java ? 

Ans : Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to transfer it over a network or to
store it in a  file or database in java, serialization is done by implemeting the serializable interface.

Q4. What is the Serializable interface in java ?

Ans : The Serialization interface in java is a marker interface that has no methods . it is used to mark classes that can be serialization,
meaning their object instances can be converted into Stream of bytes.

Q5. What is deserialzation in java ?

Ans : Deserialazation is the proccess of converting a stream of bytes back into an object instance. this is done after an object has been serialzation.

Q6. How is serialzation achieved in java ?

Ans : serialization is achieved in java by implemeting the serialization interface . when an object is serialized, its state is converted 
into a stream of bytes , which can then be transferred over a network or stored in a file or database.

Q7.How is deserialzation achieved in java ?

Ans : Deserialzation is achieved in java by reading a Stream of bytes and using them to recreate the original object instance. this is done by calling the readObject()
method of an ObjectInputStream instance .

Q8. How can you avoid certain member varialbles of class from getting serialzation ?

Ans : Mark  member variables as static or transient, and those member variables will no more be a part of Serialzation.

Q9. What classes are available in the java IO file Classes API ?

Ans : The following classes are availble in the java IO API and are important to work with files in java.

File
RandomAccessFile
FileInputStream
FileReader
FileOuoputStream
FileWriter

Q10.What is difference between Externalizable and Serialzation interface ?

Ans : 		Serialzation							Externalizable

it is a marker interface and it doesn't have ------->	it's not maker interface it has method's called 
any method								writeExternal() and readExternal()

Yes, serializable provides its own default ---------->	No, we need to override writeExternal() and readExternal()
serialization process.							for the serialization proccess to happen.

it provide less control				------------>	Externalizable provide

constructor is not called during 		------------->	Constructor is called during deserialization
deserialization.
