Q1.How to create an object in java ?
ANS: there are several ways by which we can create object of a class in java as we all know a class 
	provides the blueprint for object , you create an object from a class . this concetp is under-rated 
	and somtimes proves to be beneficial as this concept is bypassed by many programmers and sometimes evern 
	do ask from interview.



methods : 
there are many different ways to create object in java . the help of programs to  illustrate internal working by
which we can create object in java.

1.using new keyword

2.using new instance

3.using clone() method 

4.using deserialization 

5.using newinstance() method of  constructor class

Q2.what is the use of a new keyword in java .
ANS: the 'new' keyword in java is used to create an instance of an object . it allocates memory to an object an object and
	returns a reference to the object created.it is used with a constructor to create an object.

Q3. what are the differnt type of variables in java ?
ANS:		*static variables 
		*instance variables
		*local veriable


Q4. what is the difference between instance variables and local variables ?
ANS: 			Instance variable							Local veriables
		instance veriables are associated with		 	Local variables are declared and used within  	
		an instance or object of a class 			 	a method, constructor, or block .
		
		each instance of a class has its own copy	 	they are temporary variable that hold data for a
		of instance variables, which means that 	 	specific scope of block of code.
		the values of these variables can vary from 
		one instance to another.

		instance variables are declared within a class	local variables are created when a method, constructor, 
		but outside any method, constructor , block.		or block .

		they are typically used to represent the state	Local variables are only accessible within  the scope in 
		or attributes of an object.					which they are declared.



Q5.in which area memery is allocated for instance variable and local veriable ?
ANS: instance variables are allocated in the heap and local variables are allocated in the stack.



Q6.what is method overloading ?
ANS:Method overloading in java is a feature that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name
	but different parameters. the java compiler distinguishes these method by the number , type , and order of
	parameters. overloading is used to provide multiply ways to call a method for different use cases, making code
	more readable and reusable.
