Q1. what are the conditional operatore in java ?

ANS :they are used when a condition comprises more than one boolean expression.
	for instance. if we want to print a number only if it is greater than 2 and less than 5,
	then we will use conditional operators to combine the 2 expression. we have 3 type of 
	conditional  opearators -logical - and ,logical -or and ternary operator.


Logical - and operator(&&):- 
it is used when we want the condition to be true if both the expressions are true.

syntax :
	if(condition - 1&& condition -2) {
	statement;
	}

Logical -or operator (||) :- 
this operator is used when we are satisfied as long as any one of the boolean expressions is evaluated as true.

syntax : 
		if(condition -1 || condition -2 ){
		statement;
		}

ternary operator (?:) :
it is a smaller version of the if - else statement. if the condition is true then the statement - 1 is executed else the 
statement  -2 is executed .

syntax :-

		condition ? statement -1 : statement -2;


Q2. what are the type of operators based on the  number of operands ?

ANS: there are tree type of operators in java based on the number of operands. they are :

	* Unary operator 

	*Binary operator 
	
	* Ternary operator

Q3. what is the use of switch case in java programming ?

ANS : the switch case in java is used to select one of many code blocks for execution.

Break statement : as java reaches a break  keyword,the control breaks. out of the switch block.the execution of code stops on encountering this 
			   this keyword, and the case testing inside the block ends as the match is found. a lot of execution time can be saved because it 
			    igoner the rest of the code's execution when there is a break. 
			    default keyword : the keyword is used to specify the code executed when the expression does not match any test code.

			   the switch case in java works like and if - else ladder , i.e., multiple condition can be checked at once . switch is provide
			    with an expression that can be constand or literal expression that can be evaluated . the value of the expression is matched
			    with each test case till a  match is found . if there is no match , the default keyword , if specified - the associated code executes.
			    otherwise , the code specified for the matched test case is executed.

for example : the code below uses the montly number to calculate the month name : 

	public class main 
{
	public static void main(String [] args )
	{
		int month =4;
		switch(month) 
			{
				case 1 : 
					System.out.println("January");
				case 2 :
					System.out.println("February");
				case 3 :
					System.out.println("March");
				case 4 :
					System.out.println("April");
				case 5 :
					System.out.println("May");
				case 6 :
					System.out.println("June");
				break;
			              default : System.out.println(" In next half ");
}
	}
			}


Output : 
	April



Q4.what are the priority levels of arithmatic operator in java ?

ANS : there are two priority levels of arithmatic operator in java . they are as follow :

	* High priority * / % 

	*Low priority + -


Q5. what are the conditional statements and use of conditional statements in java ?

ANS: * if to specify a block of code to be executed , if a specified condition is true 

	* else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the some condition is false

	*else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false

	* switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

Q6. what is the syntax of if - else statement ?

ANS : if(condition1) 
{
	// block of code to be executed if condition1 is true 
}
else 
{
	// block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false 
}


Q7.what are the 3 type of iterative statements in java ?

ANS : 3 type of iterative statements in java :

	*for loop
	*while loop
	*do-while loop


Q8. difference between for loop and do while loop ?

ANS :    		For Loop						Do-While Loop
		statement(s) is executed once		condition is checked after the statement
		the condition is checked.			is executed.

		it migth be that statement(s) 		statement(s) is executed at least once.
		gets executed zero times.		

		for the single statement,brackets		Brackets are always complusory.
		are not compulsory.				

		initialization may be outside or		intialization may be outside or withine the 
		in a condition box.				loop.

		for loop is entry controlled loop.		do-while is an exit controlled loop.

		for(init;condition;iteration)			do {statement(s) ; }
		{ statement(s) }					while (condition);



Q9.write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 .

ANS :
	public class printnumber
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		for(int i=1; i<=10; i++)
			{
				System.out.println(i);
			}
	}
}
